# GUB-Student-Information-Portal-using-C
The name of project is “GUB Students Information Portal”. This project is array structure and console based. Project is made by C language. By using this project, it will be much easier to find a student’s information with a second.
 There are many options in our project to find information. My main purpose of this project is to reduce time in searching a student information whenever it needed. The code contains seven user functions. Functions are Add_New_Students,    Find_by_Roll,     Find_by_First_Name, Find_by_CGPA,Total_Students,Delete_Information_of_a_Student,Update_Student_Information. Each function has its own work.
The idea is to form an individual functions for every operation. All the functions are unified together to form software.

Add Student Details: Get data from user and add a student to the list of students. While adding the students into the list, check for the uniqueness of the roll number.
	
Find the student by the given roll number: This function is to find the student record for the given roll number and print the details.

Find the student by the given first name: This function is to find all the students with the given first name and print their details.

Find the students registered in a course: This function is to find all the students who have registered for a given course.
Count of Students: This function is to print the total number of students in the system.

Delete a student: This function is to delete the student record for the given roll number.

Update Student: This function is to update the student records. This function does not ask for new details for all fields but the user should be able to pick and choose what he wants to update.
